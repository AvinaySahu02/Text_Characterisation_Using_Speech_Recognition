# Text_Characterisation_Using_Speech_Recognition
While making this project we will see how we can extract text from voice or speech using the audio (.wav)data file using Speech Recognition and use it to do text analysis using python. Speech Recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers with the main benefit of search ability.Speech Recognition has various applications and is widely used today in different fields like Google Voice Assistant, Voice assist in cars, Call routing etc.The main objective of the project is to make the use of various Speech Recognition APIs and to convert the spoken speech into text array.
